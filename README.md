👋 Hi! I’m @delacruz97

💻 I’m a Full Stack Developer focused on the JavaScript ecosystem. I enjoy building real, scalable, and well-structured applications—taking ideas from concept to production.

🚀 I’m interested in joining and creating large projects where I can contribute to both frontend and backend while improving my skills, best practices, and teamwork.

🧠 I’m also highly interested in integrating Artificial Intelligence into web and mobile apps (chatbots, assistants, recommendations, automations, etc.).

🌱 Tech & tools:
- JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- React, Redux
- React Native (Expo)
- Node.js, Express
- SQL
- REST APIs
- Git / GitHub
- Canva (logos, visual design, creative assets)

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on projects where I can contribute, keep learning, and work with a team that values clean code and good practices.
